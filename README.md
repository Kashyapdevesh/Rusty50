*High Performance, Low latency Trading engine* built on the new kid on the block *"Rust"*. 

This project aims at analyzing the stock market / crypto market under various quantitative strategies and models 
to come up with the best custom strategy to beat the market. 
We will be focusing on building faster setups than the current Python based models while ensuring flexibility
to accommodate any strategies from simple mathematical formulas to advanced machine learning models and platforms for the trades.
# Contributing
To contribute to the project, check out our guide : [contributing].

# Areas to work on -
>*Note* - This is not an exhaustive list of things to-do. We are open to any suggestions or sub-projects that you are interested in and want to work on!


 ## Trading Strategy Planning and Testing
 - Building quantitative indicators like RSI, Moving Averages
 - Pattern Recognition based on Price Action Trading Techniques
 - Fundamental Analysis on Company Financial docs programmatically 
 - Supporting arbitrage models for Cryptocurrencies
 - Working on ML models to build a custom model that combines existing model outputs into one


 ## Back Testing Engine
 - Build a generic back tester that supports all trading strategies
 - Connect with python to enable data visualization and build understandable reports


 ## Concurrency to reduce latency
 - Focus on splitting work onto different threads to ensure maximum parallelization and reducing time taken to process data


 ## Data Fetching from different APIs and Parsing into model
 - Collecting data from different sources and converting into the custom models developed
 - Include the API setup for making the actual trades with trading platforms

>*P.S* - No kind of prior financial knowledge is required for this at all.  We will be there to work you through the basics. 

Feel free to message us on [discord] or hop on a call with us to clarify anything or just to talk about Rust or the project!
